  ### üåø [UBC Agrobot (Lead Software Engineer)](https://ubcagrobot.com)
  I am the Lead DevOps Engineer at UBC Agrobot, a design team focused on designing autonomous agriculture robots and their support systems. The team repositories can be seen here. Some of my notable contributions as sub-team lead can be seen below.
  - Led a team of 8 engineers to upgrade ML model deployment infrastructure for real-time applications using TensorRT and GPU memory optimizations, reducing inference times by 83%
  - Optimized image processing performance using CUDA-accelerated matrix operations, increasing GPU utilization efficiency and overall detection throughput by 49%
  - Developed an autonomous navigation system using LiDAR and camera fusion for precise localization and mapping, improving mapping precision to within 0.1 meters
  - Implemented physics-based Gazebo simulations to fine-tune motion planning and control algorithms in dynamic environments

  ### üñ•Ô∏è [Docker SSH Client](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/Docker-SSH-Client)
  - Created a GoLang CLI tool to enable seamless SSH container access across local and remote environments, including user authentication and real-time status updates through gRPC services

  ### ‚öôÔ∏è [UBC Department of Manufacturing Engineering (Platform Engineer Intern)](https://manufacturing.engineering.ubc.ca/)
  As a Software Engineer working in undergraduate research, I worked to define and implement data storage systems and perform data analysis. Although none of the code or systems I have developed are public, here is a summary of my biggest accomplishments:
  - Migrated backend infrastructure to the cloud with Terraform and AWS resources (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3), saving $8000+ in operational costs and computing resources
  - Improved data retrieval times by 72% by integrating Redis in-memory caching with a PostgreSQL database for efficient user data storage
  - Designed a distributed messaging solution using object-oriented programming and Apache Kafka, achieving an overall 34% reduction in latency for upstream services
  - Built an API layer in FastAPI to integrate a JavaScript frontend with a database ORM, reducing manual querying time by 10+ hours per week through streamlined data handling

  ### üåø [UBC Agrobot (Software Engineer)](https://ubcagrobot.com)
  I formerly worked on the embedded systems subteam for UBC Agrobot, focusing on developing real-time software applications applications and optimizing ML image processing using computer vision and GPU optimization techniques, my primary achievements include:
  - Developed and deployed C++ components using ROS2 and multi-threading to improve internal robotic system communication, reducing system-wide network latency from 2s to 0.1s
  - Automated unit, integration and performance testing workflows with Python and Bash scripts, reducing manual effort and accelerating sprint delivery by 46%
  - Reduced system setup times by 30% using custom multi-platform Docker containers to automate local and staging environment setup, eliminating dependency issues for 20+ developers
  - Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to eliminate manual build and deployment operations, reducing release times by 63%

  ### ü§ñ [Github Notification System](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/Github-Notifier)
  - ‚óè	Decreased response times by 55% by developing a GoLang application to improve notification visibility on Slack using GitHub APIs and webhook payloads

  ### ‚òÅÔ∏è [Automated AWS Deployment](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/AWS-Deployment)
  - Reduced project deployment times by over 71% using Helm IaC templates to automate microservice architecture configuration on Kubernetes clusters across 5+ multiple availability zones 

  ### üêç [Python Script Collection](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/Python-Scripts)
  - Created a collection of Python scripts for automating common tasks, including web scraping, data analysis, and file manipulation, saving 10 hours of manual work per week.
