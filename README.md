  ### ‚öôÔ∏è [UBC Department of Manufacturing Engineering](https://manufacturing.engineering.ubc.ca/)
  As a Software Engineer working in undergraduate research, I worked to define and implement data storage systems and perform data analysis. Although none of the code or systems I have developed are public, here is a summary of my biggest accomplishments:
  - Architected a PostgreSQL database schema supporting 10+ tables and indexes, improving data retrieval times by 62% through the integration of Redis in-memory caching.
  - Implemented a backend API layer in Python using Flask-RESTful, yielding monthly savings of 112 person-hours by abstracting database queries.
  - Performed exploratory data analysis using NumPy and Pandas, identifying key data trends and patterns, which were visualized with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets using Excel, then built PowerBI dashboards that communicated insights to internal teams, improving decision-making efficiency.

  ### üåø [UBC Agrobot (Embedded Software Engineer)](https://ubcagrobot.com)
  I formerly worked on the embedded systems subteam for UBC Agrobot, focusing on developing real-time software applications applications and optimizing ML image processing using computer vision and GPU optimization techniques, my primary achievements include:
  - Led a team of 8 engineers and engaged in system architecture reviews, revamping inter-process communication using C++, Python and ROS2, reducing system-wide latency by over 90%. 
  - Optimized image streaming inference using multi-threading and GPU optimization libraries in an Nvidia Jetson Linux development environment, increasing system throughput by 5x.
  - Spearheaded the development of automated unit, integration and performance testing infrastructure with PyTest and Bash, accelerating sprint delivery by 35%.
  - Identified and resolved 7+ system bottlenecks using profiling and function trace reports from Py-Spy, perf and Nsight Systems, ensuring robust code functionality.

  ### ü§ñ [Github Notification System](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/Github-Notifier)
  - Constructed GoLang application to query REST/GraphQL APIs upon receiving webhook payloads and send notifications to users on alternative platforms, increasing response times by 20%.

  ### ‚òÅÔ∏è [Automated AWS Deployment](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/AWS-Deployment)
  - Developed infrastructure-as-code templates on AWS using Terraform, and automated container deployments using Kubernetes/Helm, powering a cloud-hosted movie recommendation website.

  ### üêç [Python Script Collection](https://github.com/Ishaan-Datta/Python-Scripts)
  - Created a collection of Python scripts for automating common tasks, including web scraping, data analysis, and file manipulation, saving 10 hours of manual work per week.
